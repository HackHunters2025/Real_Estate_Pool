---

## 🧩 **Architecture Overview**

EstateX Intelligence follows a **clean two-layer architecture**:

### **1. Frontend — Real-time Analytics Dashboard**

* React (Vite)
* Tailwind UI
* Recharts (visualization)
* Global Property Context (multi-property management)
* Reusable B2B components for forecasting, ESG, pricing, risk, etc.

### **2. Backend — Multi-Agent Intelligence Layer (FastAPI)**

Each business function is handled by a dedicated AI agent:

| Agent                | Business Function                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| forecasting_agent    | Cash flow & rent forecasting      |
| pricing_agent        | Dynamic rent recommendations      |
| tenant_churn_agent   | Retention risk scoring            |
| occupancy_agent      | Occupancy forecasting             |
| esg_compliance_agent | Sustainability compliance         |
| maintenance_agent    | Preventive maintenance prediction |
| lease_nlp_agent      | Automated lease extraction        |
| portfolio_agent      | Investment optimization           |
| scenario_agent       | What-if analysis engine           |
| news_agent           | City-level market sentiment       |
| alerts_agent         | Smart alerts & signals            |
| memory_agent         | Cross-agent knowledge persistence |

This modularity allows enterprises to **deploy, extend, or isolate agents independently**.

## 📁 **Data Inputs (Enterprise-Grade Property Management)**

Each property has a dedicated data directory:

```
backend/data/properties/<property_id>/
```

Supported datasets:

* `rent_history.csv`
* `maintenance.csv`
* `esg.json`
* `features.json`
* `lease_docs/…`

This allows each property to have **distinct independent intelligence**.

No refresh.
No hard-coding.
True multi-property architecture.
